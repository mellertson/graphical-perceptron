# Perceptron
An object-oriented perceptron neural network implemented in Python 3.6+ with a graphical visualization of the network 
as it runs step-by-step.  I made this to help me better understand the *magic* of machine learning. 

## Dependencies
* Python 3.6+

## Recommended
I highly recommend using `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper`.

## Installation
After setting up your virtual environment, just run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
